# Using the Swift Playgrounds

## Getting Started

This GitBook page gives an overview of the available Swift Playgrounds, their intention and some initial motivation on why I created these. As the playgrounds are self-documented making extensive use of Markdown I leave it to you to decide wheher you're going to jump into a topic and deep-dive in the calm seas of those playgrounds.

Please feel free to copy, share, and re-use the playgrounds as I always include an "I don't care" copyright, so I'm happy to donate my findings and results to the comunity without any loopholes. If you like you might mention where you stumbled across the idea and you might cite the original author\(s\), but that's certainly not a must.

## Using the Playgrounds

All playgrounds are hosted and published on [GitHub](https://github.com/MatiMax/swift-playgrounds). So please feel free to either clone or fork them. If you want to see some additions you might write a comment and ask for such. If you have some suggestions for improvements, please feel free to write a comment or modify the code, and thereafter post a pull request.
