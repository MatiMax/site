# Swift Playgrounds by Category

## Computer Science Theory & Algorithms

| Swift Playground | Topic |
| :--- | :--- |
| Factorial | Very simple demo of a recursion algorithm in Swift |
| Function Call Mapping | Demonstration of calling functions dynamically using a routing pattern |
| Syntax Tree | Demonstration of a tree algorithm adapted to the Swift programming language |
| Tail Recursion | Demonstration of the tail recursion algorithm adapted to the Swift programming language |
| Using Opaque Types | Demonstration of using Swift opaque types |
| Using Phantom Types | Demonstration of using phantom types in Swift |

## Networking

| Swift Playground | Topic |
| :--- | :--- |
| DNSResolve5 | Resolve host IP address by a given name using Apple’s Core Foundation with `CFHost`. This _won’t_ resolve the host alias names, though |
| IPHostAddressResolution5 | Resolve host IP address by a given name using GLibC’s standard networking C function `gethostbyaddr`. This _does_resolve the host alias names |
| IPHostAddressResolution5 SwiftUI | Same as `IPHostAddressResolution5` with a simple UI |

## Integrating C

| Swift Playground | Topic |
| :--- | :--- |
| IPHostAddressResolution5 | Resolve host IP address by a given name using GLibC’s standard networking C function `gethostbyaddr`. This _does_resolve the host alias names |
| IPHostAddressResolution5 SwiftUI | Same as `IPHostAddressResolution5` with a simple UI |

## SwiftUI

| Swift Playground | Topic |
| :--- | :--- |
| IPHostAddressResolution5 SwiftUI | Same as `IPHostAddressResolution5` with a simple UI |
| Pulsating Custom Button | A custom SwiftUI button with a blinking LED indicator mimicking buttons found on KORG’s synthesisers |
| QR Code | How to platform-independently generate a bitmap QR code using Apple’s CoreImage `CIFilter` |
| QR Code iOS | Same as `QR Code`, specifically designed for i\(Pad\)OS |
| QR Code macOS | Same as `QR Code`, specifically designed for macOS |
| SpeedMaths | A simple example of using a list view with a custom row content view with field-exit handler and context-dependent colouring |
