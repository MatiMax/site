# About this GitBook

## Motivation

During my carreer as computer scientist and engineer I collected a diverse assortment of knowledge, insights and learnings which I suppose to be helpful when shared with the community in order to either help out or foster the learning of people interested in those same topics.

## Time Constraints

Although I would be happy to repsond to questions asked or comments made I have to say that this GitBook is curated using some of my rare spare time. It therefore might take some time to react on your feedback. So my plea is to be patient if you don't see immediate responses.
